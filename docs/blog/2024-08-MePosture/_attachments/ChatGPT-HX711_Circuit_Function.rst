The HX711 is a popular 24-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) designed
specifically for weigh scales and other applications that require
precise measurement of small signals. Here's what the HX711 circuit
does:

1. **Signal Amplification:**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The HX711 has an integrated programmable gain amplifier (PGA) that
   amplifies the low-level signals from sensors like load cells, which
   are typically used in weigh scales. The gain can be set to 32, 64, or
   128, allowing the small signal from the sensor to be amplified to a
   level that can be digitized effectively.

2. **Analog-to-Digital Conversion:**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  After amplification, the HX711 converts the analog signal from the
   sensor into a digital signal. This conversion is done with a high
   resolution of 24 bits, which allows for very precise measurements.

3. **Digital Output:**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The digital output from the HX711 is sent out serially using a
   two-wire interface (clock and data lines). This makes it easy to
   interface with microcontrollers like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or other
   embedded systems.

4. **Power Management:**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The HX711 also includes features for low-power operation. It can be
   put into a power-down mode to save energy when not in use.

5. **Precision Weighing Applications:**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The HX711 is most commonly used in digital weighing scales. It
   interfaces with load cells, which are sensors that measure force or
   weight, and provides the necessary amplification and digitization of
   the load cell signal to produce an accurate weight reading.

In summary, the HX711 circuit is essential for applications that need to
accurately measure small analog signals, especially in the context of
weight measurement using load cells.

Is has only one channel, right?

ChatGPT:
^^^^^^^^

14:56

The HX711 actually has **two channels**, labeled as **Channel A** and
**Channel B**. However, there are some differences between the two
channels:

-  **Channel A**: This channel is the primary channel and offers
   programmable gain settings. You can set the gain to 128 or 64. This
   channel is typically used for connecting to the load cell or strain
   gauge in a weigh scale application. Because of the higher gain
   options, Channel A is used for more precise measurements.

-  **Channel B**: This channel has a fixed gain of 32, and it is
   generally used less frequently than Channel A. It can be used for
   other sensor inputs where less precision is required compared to
   Channel A.

So, while the HX711 does have two channels, Channel A is more commonly
used for high-precision applications, and Channel B offers an
additional, less sensitive input if needed.

Is there some circuit available which provides4 or more 24-bit ADCs via
SPI?

ChatGPT:
^^^^^^^^

14:58

Yes, there are several circuits and integrated circuits (ICs) available
that provide multiple 24-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and can
communicate via SPI. Here are some examples:

1. **ADS1258 (Texas Instruments)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Features:** The ADS1258 is a 24-bit, 16-channel (single-ended) or
   8-channel (differential) ADC. It supports SPI communication and has a
   programmable data rate. It is widely used in applications that
   require high precision and multiple inputs.

-  **Channels:** 16 single-ended or 8 differential

2. **LTC2498 (Analog Devices)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   8-channel (differential) ADC. It operates with a simple SPI interface
   and provides no latency when switching channels.
-  **SPI Interface:** Yes

-  **Channels:** 16 single-ended or 8 differential

3. **AD7124-8 (Analog Devices)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   differential or 16-channel single-ended ADC with an integrated
   programmable gain amplifier (PGA). It offers high precision and is
   designed for sensor measurement.
-  **SPI Interface:** Yes
-  **Resolution:** 24-bit

4. **ADS1278 (Texas Instruments)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   24-bit, delta-sigma ADCs. This is particularly useful in applications
   where all channels need to be sampled at the same time.
-  **SPI Interface:** Yes
-  **Resolution:** 24-bit
-  **Channels:** 8 differential

5. **AD7708/AD7718 (Analog Devices)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Features:** These are low power, 24-bit sigma-delta ADCs with up to
   8 single-ended or 4 differential channels, offering good performance
   for low-frequency measurements.
-  **SPI Interface:** Yes
-  **Resolution:** 24-bit
-  **Channels:** 8 single-ended or 4 differential

Custom Circuit:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need more than the available channels in a single IC, you can
also design a circuit that uses multiple ADC ICs like the ADS1232 or
ADS1256, both of which are 24-bit ADCs with 2 or 4 channels, and connect
them to a microcontroller via SPI. Each ADC IC can be addressed
separately using different chip select (CS) lines.

These options should cover a wide range of applications where multiple
high-precision, 24-bit ADCs are required, and SPI is the preferred
communication method.

Let's look closer to the subset (1., 2.. 3., 4.).

For which do Python libraries exist? For which Arduino / ESP libraries?

ChatGPT:
^^^^^^^^

15:02

Let's break down the availability of Python and Arduino/ESP libraries
for the subset of ADC ICs mentioned (ADS1258, LTC2498, AD7124-8, and
ADS1278):

1. **ADS1258 (Texas Instruments)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Python Libraries:**

   -  **Availability:** There is no official Python library specifically
      for the ADS1258, but you can find generic libraries or code
      examples that allow communication with SPI devices in Python, such
      as ``spidev`` on Raspberry Pi, which can be used to interface with
      the ADS1258.

-  **Arduino/ESP Libraries:**

   -  **Availability:** There isn't an official or widely-used Arduino
      library for the ADS1258. However, similar to Python, you can use
      the SPI library in Arduino to manually communicate with the
      ADS1258 by implementing the necessary protocols.

2. **LTC2498 (Analog Devices)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Python Libraries:**

   -  **Availability:** There is no specific Python library for the
      LTC2498, but, like the ADS1258, you can use generic SPI
      communication libraries such as ``spidev`` on Raspberry Pi to
      interact with it.

-  **Arduino/ESP Libraries:**

   -  **Availability:** There isn't a widely recognized library
      specifically for the LTC2498 for Arduino/ESP. You can still
      communicate with this chip using the SPI library and write custom
      code to handle its specific communication protocol.

3. **AD7124-8 (Analog Devices)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Python Libraries:**

   -  **Availability:** Analog Devices provides a Python library for the
      AD7124, which is part of the pyadi-iio package. This library
      allows easy interfacing with the AD7124 when connected to an
      appropriate interface like an ADALM2000 or through a direct SPI
      connection.
   -  **Library Link:**

      library for the AD7124, which makes it easier to use with Arduino
      or ESP32 boards.
   -  **Library Link:** `Arduino AD7124
      Library <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/arduino/tree/master/Arduino%20IC%20Shields/ad7124>`__

4. **ADS1278 (Texas Instruments)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Python Libraries:**

   -  **Availability:** There is no specific Python library for the
      ADS1278, but you can use SPI communication via libraries like
      ``spidev`` to interface with the device.

-  **Arduino/ESP Libraries:**

   -  **Availability:** The ADS1278 does not have a specific Arduino
      library, but like the others, you can use the Arduino SPI library
      to communicate with it by manually implementing the protocol
      required for the ADS1278.

Summary:
~~~~~~~~

-  **AD7124-8** has the best support with both official Python and
   Arduino libraries available, making it easier to use with both types
   of platforms.
-  For the **ADS1258, LTC2498,** and **ADS1278,** no specific libraries
   are available, but generic SPI libraries (like ``spidev`` for Python
   or the SPI library for Arduino) can be used to interface with these
   ADCs by writing custom code.

If you are looking for ease of use and existing library support, the
AD7124-8 is the most straightforward option. For the others, you will
need to do more manual work to communicate with them.
