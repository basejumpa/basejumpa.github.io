I'd like to connect 4 loads cells to a AD7124-8 circuit which is
connected to an ESP32-WROOM via SPI. Every 100ms a sample comprising 4
readings (a value of each load cell) shall be sent via Bluetooth.

To achieve this setup, you'll need to follow several steps to connect
and configure the components properly. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Hardware Connections**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Load Cells**: Each load cell has four wires: Excitation+ (E+),
   Excitation- (E-), Signal+ (S+), and Signal- (S-).

   -  Connect E+ and E- of all load cells to the same power supply
      (typically 5V for E+ and GND for E-).
   -  Connect the S+ and S- of each load cell to the differential input
      channels of the AD7124-8. This ADC has multiple differential input
      pairs, so connect each load cell to a different pair of inputs.

-  **AD7124-8 (ADC)**:

   -  Connect the SPI lines (MISO, MOSI, SCLK, and CS) of the AD7124-8
      to the corresponding pins on the ESP32-WROOM.
   -  Ensure proper power supply and ground connections between the
      ESP32, AD7124-8, and the load cells.
   -  Refer to the AD7124-8 datasheet to properly configure the analog
      inputs for differential measurements and set the appropriate gain
      for the load cell signals.

-  **ESP32-WROOM**:

   -  Use the SPI interface to communicate with the AD7124-8.
   -  The Bluetooth module of the ESP32 will be used to send data.

2. **Software Configuration**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ESP32 Code
^^^^^^^^^^

1. **Initialize SPI Communication**:

   -  Set up the SPI bus on the ESP32 to communicate with the AD7124-8.
   -  Configure the SPI settings (mode, clock speed, etc.) as required
      by the AD7124-8.

2. **Configure AD7124-8**:

   -  Initialize the AD7124-8 and configure it for reading the four load
      cells. This includes setting the appropriate channels, gain,
      filter, and reference voltage.
   -  You may need to write specific register values to configure the
      ADC channels. Check the AD7124-8 datasheet for details.

3. **Sampling Loop**:

   -  Create a loop to read the ADC values from the AD7124-8 every
      100ms.
   -  Read each load cell's value from its corresponding channel.
   -  Store these readings in a data structure.

4. **Bluetooth Communication**:

   -  Initialize the Bluetooth interface on the ESP32 using the Arduino
      or ESP-IDF libraries.
   -  Send the collected data over Bluetooth. You can format the data as
      a simple string, JSON, or another format suitable for your
      application.

5. **Timing**:

   -  Use a timer or delay function to ensure that the sampling and
      Bluetooth sending loop runs every 100ms.

Example Pseudocode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code::

   #include <SPI.h>
   #include <BluetoothSerial.h>

   #define CS_PIN 5  // Chip Select pin for SPI
   BluetoothSerial SerialBT;

   void setup() {
       // Initialize SPI and Bluetooth
       SPI.begin();
       pinMode(CS_PIN, OUTPUT);
       SerialBT.begin("LoadCellData");

       // Initialize AD7124-8
       initializeAD7124();
   }

   void loop() {
       static unsigned long lastTime = 0;
       if (millis() - lastTime >= 100) {
           lastTime = millis();
           int32_t loadCell1 = readADC(0);  // Read channel 0
           int32_t loadCell2 = readADC(1);  // Read channel 1
           int32_t loadCell3 = readADC(2);  // Read channel 2
           int32_t loadCell4 = readADC(3);  // Read channel 3

           // Create a data packet to send via Bluetooth
           String data = String(loadCell1) + "," + String(loadCell2) + "," + String(loadCell3) + "," + String(loadCell4);
           SerialBT.println(data);
       }
   }

   void initializeAD7124() {
       // Implement AD7124 initialization code here
   }

   int32_t readADC(uint8_t channel) {
       // Implement ADC reading code here based on channel
       int32_t result = 0;
       digitalWrite(CS_PIN, LOW);
       // SPI transaction to read from AD7124-8
       //...
       digitalWrite(CS_PIN, HIGH);
       return result;
   }

3. **Testing and Calibration**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Calibration**: You'll need to calibrate each load cell to convert
   the raw ADC values into meaningful weight measurements. This
   typically involves applying known weights to the load cells and
   calculating calibration coefficients.

-  **Testing**: Run your code and test the setup to ensure that data is
   being read correctly from each load cell and transmitted via
   Bluetooth.

4. **Optimization and Refinement**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for SPI communication,
   ADC readings, and Bluetooth transmission.
-  **Power Management**: Consider optimizing power consumption,
   especially if the system is battery-operated.

This setup should allow you to sample the four load cells every 100ms
and transmit the readings via Bluetooth using the ESP32.

To create a PlatformIO project for your setup, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up PlatformIO**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you haven't already installed PlatformIO, you'll need to install it.
PlatformIO can be installed as an extension in Visual Studio Code or as
a standalone CLI tool.

-  **For Visual Studio Code**:

   1. Open Visual Studio Code.
   2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in
      the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
   3. Search for “PlatformIO IDE” and install it.
   4. After installation, PlatformIO will be available in the
      bottom-left corner of Visual Studio Code.

-  **For CLI**:

   1. Install Python (if not already installed).

   2. Run the following command in your terminal:

      ::

         pip install platformio

2. **Create a New PlatformIO Project**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Open Visual Studio Code** and go to the PlatformIO Home (click on
   the PlatformIO icon in the bottom-left corner).
2. Click on “New Project”.
3. **Configure the new project**:

   -  **Name**: Give your project a name (e.g., ``LoadCellProject``).
   -  **Board**: Select ``ESP32 Dev Module`` (which corresponds to the
      ESP32-WROOM).
   -  **Framework**: Choose ``Arduino``.
   -  **Location**: Choose where you want to save the project.

4. Click **Finish**.

3. **Write the Code**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After creating the project, PlatformIO will generate a directory
structure. Write the code into the ``src/main.cpp`` file.

**main.cpp**
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code::

   #include <Arduino.h>
   #include <SPI.h>
   #include <BluetoothSerial.h>

   #define CS_PIN 5  // Chip Select pin for SPI

   BluetoothSerial SerialBT;

   void setup() {
       // Initialize Serial for debugging
       Serial.begin(115200);

       // Initialize SPI
       SPI.begin();
       pinMode(CS_PIN, OUTPUT);

       // Initialize Bluetooth
       SerialBT.begin("LoadCellData");

       // Initialize AD7124-8
       initializeAD7124();

       Serial.println("Setup Complete");
   }

   void loop() {
       static unsigned long lastTime = 0;
       if (millis() - lastTime >= 100) {
           lastTime = millis();

           // Read data from ADC channels
           int32_t loadCell1 = readADC(0);  // Read channel 0
           int32_t loadCell2 = readADC(1);  // Read channel 1
           int32_t loadCell3 = readADC(2);  // Read channel 2
           int32_t loadCell4 = readADC(3);  // Read channel 3

           // Create a data packet to send via Bluetooth
           String data = String(loadCell1) + "," + String(loadCell2) + "," + String(loadCell3) + "," + String(loadCell4);
           SerialBT.println(data);
           Serial.println(data); // Also print to Serial for debugging
       }
   }

   void initializeAD7124() {
       // Implement AD7124 initialization code here
       // e.g., Configure registers for channel settings
   }

   int32_t readADC(uint8_t channel) {
       // Implement ADC reading code here based on the selected channel
       int32_t result = 0;

       digitalWrite(CS_PIN, LOW);
       // SPI transaction to read from AD7124-8
       // Example: result = SPI.transfer16(...);
       digitalWrite(CS_PIN, HIGH);

       return result;
   }

4. **Configure PlatformIO Environment**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PlatformIO uses a ``platformio.ini`` file for configuration. PlatformIO
should generate a basic ``platformio.ini`` file when you create a new
project. Here's a minimal configuration for your ESP32 project:

**platformio.ini**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code::

   [env:esp32dev]
   platform = espressif32
   board = esp32dev
   framework = arduino
   monitor_speed = 115200

This configuration specifies the platform (Espressif32), the board
(ESP32 Dev Module), the framework (Arduino), and the serial monitor
speed.

5. **Build and Upload the Project**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Build the Project**: Click on the checkmark icon in the bottom bar
   of Visual Studio Code or use the command palette
   (``Ctrl + Shift + P``) and search for “PlatformIO: Build”.
-  **Upload the Project**: Click on the arrow icon in the bottom bar or
   use the command palette to search for “PlatformIO: Upload”. Ensure
   your ESP32 is connected to your computer via USB.

6. **Monitor Serial Output**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To monitor the serial output for debugging, click on the plug icon in
the bottom bar or use the command palette and search for “PlatformIO:
Serial Monitor”.

7. **Testing and Debugging**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Make sure that the ESP32 is connected properly, and the Bluetooth
   device is discoverable.
-  Connect to the ESP32 using a Bluetooth-enabled device to receive the
   data stream.
-  Use the Serial Monitor in PlatformIO to view debug output and ensure
   that the system is functioning correctly.

With this setup, your ESP32 should read data from the AD7124-8 every
100ms and send it via Bluetooth.

It's just a question, please don't change anything based on that
question yet:

Since I can't see any pairing of Bluetooth connection in this setup one
or more devices can just receive the signals, right?

ChatGPT:
^^^^^^^^

Yes, in the current setup, the ESP32 is acting as a Bluetooth Serial
(Bluetooth SPP) device that broadcasts data. Since there's no explicit
pairing or authentication process in the code, any Bluetooth-enabled
device within range that knows how to listen to the Bluetooth Serial
output could potentially receive the data. This setup is essentially an
open broadcast, meaning that multiple devices can receive the
transmitted data simultaneously, provided they are within range and have
connected to the ESP32's Bluetooth serial stream.

If you want to restrict access, you'd typically implement Bluetooth
pairing or add some form of encryption or authentication in the
communication process.
