About Me
########

I am `Alexander <https://www.google.com/search?q=alexander+meaning>`__ (`basejumpa <https://github.com/basejumpa>`__).

My area of expertise is the software engineering of software-intensive mechatronic systems, in particular the design of software architectures. Here I try to do my best to contribute to designs that are fun for us developers and at the same time are cornerstones for a long-term competitive product.

My most important tool is asynchronous communication in written form through jointly created documents using the docs-as-code approach. My technologies of choice are Sphinx, VSCode and Git.

In my career, I have gained experience as a software and system developer, architect, product owner, scrum master, department head, teacher of computer science, mathematics and mechatronics after school, community service and mechanical engineering studies, i.e. since 2001.

Previously, I worked at `TU-Darmstadt <https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jspy>`__, `Continental <https://www.continental.com/en/>`__, `Berufsbildende Schule Technik Mainz <https://www.bbs1-mainz.com/>`__, `AKASOL <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/BorgWarner_Akasol>`__ (now part of BorgWarner) and `Marquardt Group <https://www.marquardt.com/us/>`__.

I currently work for the `VITRONIC Group <https://www.vitronic.com>`__.

Even in my free time, I can't get enough of software, electronics and mechanics. Besides technology, I enjoy exercise on land and in the water, sweet and even more salty (cycling, biking, running, hiking, swimming, free and scuba diving). I love the breathless depths of freediving and the expansive views in the mountains.
